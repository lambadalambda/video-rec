# Milestone 01 — Vector math

Goal: deterministic, dependency-free vector operations used everywhere else.

- [ ] `dot/2`, `l2_norm/1`, `normalize/1`
- [ ] `mean/1` (mean pooling) with validation
- [ ] numeric stability + edge cases (empty, zeros, mismatched dims)
- [ ] property-ish tests for invariants (where practical)
