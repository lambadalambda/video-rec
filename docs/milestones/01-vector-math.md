# Milestone 01 — Vector math

Goal: deterministic, dependency-free vector operations used everywhere else.

Prereq: `docs/milestones/00-web-mvp.md` (so we have something visible to iterate on).

- [ ] `dot/2`, `l2_norm/1`, `normalize/1`
- [ ] `mean/1` (mean pooling) with validation
- [ ] numeric stability + edge cases (empty, zeros, mismatched dims)
- [ ] property-ish tests for invariants (where practical)
